1. server.py : to be executed on your computer with sqlite3 setup
2. clientqr.py : to be executed on your Raspberry Pi with circuit properly connected.
3. ticketInfo : DB file for SQLite
4. qr2.png and qr3.png : Some sample QR Code Images

### Note

This code and blog is being submitted to Dr. Rajbir Kaur Ma'am for the CTIoT course evaluation component. I hope see allows me to post this code and blog online. I put this content and code for free-to-use purpose. 

This project was made in collaboration with my friend Kanishk Garg.
